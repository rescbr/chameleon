  PM type set by the cpu features
- Added new drop acpi table mechanism, now it's really able to drop any tables
- BootHelp is not anymore embed by default in the bootloader core, if you need the help at boot time, just install your BootHelp.txt in /Extra/ (for now GUI module still embed it)

  with or without modules
- Boot helper support (raid) is now an option (992 bytes saved)
- Fixed an issue where the prelinked kernel can't be found (the bootloader should now be fully compatible with the kextcache command line tool).
  (Also merged both adler32 function previously located in drivers.c and boot.c into one (adler32) located in boot.c)
- returned to malloc by default, instead of safe_malloc, safe_malloc(+1280 bytes) is now an option (as in revolution 616+)
- APM support is now optional (704 bytes saved)
- Fixed add_symbol function 
- Increased module hook arguments number to 6
- Added Kabyl's pci subsystem id patch 
- Added Kabyl's smbios implemention (SMBiosGetters, see Kabyl's branch.) as a module (legacy smbios implementation (SMBiosPatcher) have been also rewritten as a module)

- Removed obsolete -f option, use -x instead
- Removed -x32 option, use arch=i386 instead
- Added automatic SMBusspeed detection for lga1156 core i5/7 cpus
- Added new iMac11,1 sbios default model for lga1156 core i5/17 mobos
- md0 code. Notified xnu when an md ramdisk is specified
- Added rollover image support for selected device icons.
  Use device_<type>_o.png in theme folder. Credits goes to Blackosx.
- Revisited theme resource embedding. Using the device_<type> icons are optional with
  the exception of device_generic.
- Optimized memory detection speed
- Added displaying source device and partition number for file read operations.
- Increased boot2's maximum size from 383.5k to 447.5k.
  Updated stage 1 loaders for handling the new size limit.
- Added alternate format for setting the default partition. The user can specify the selected
  volume UUID for the "Default Partition" key.
- Implemented SPD memory automatic detection and injection,seems to work really great ...
- Factorized code to prepare a dynamic memory detection algorithm ...
- Optimized smbios table address search
- Optimized cursor spinout in textmode if no verbose mode is set
- Added ram table structures definitions
- Added getSmbios() a param permitting to select between orig and new smbios entries

- Nvidia injection fix
- pciroot would not always return correct uuid in autodection mode
- Fixed the hibernation problem in boot2/resume.c
- Fixed all new booter versions with SystemType would override the facp value even if correct,
  now keeps the facp value if correct and no override has been done, implemented a best effort algo.
  for maximizing the chance to get the most correct value before we decide to use a fixed value (1=desktop)
- Fixed display cosmetics of UUID, now a convert.c file contains all 
  conversions api, to be completed by function that we should reuse.
  
- Fixed SystemType would be always forced to a value, now optionally changed
  only if ovveriden
- Kept SystemID as the only option to change manually the system-id 
  For theses reasons, SystemId from bootConfig and SMUUID from smbiosConfig aer now DEPRECATED.

- Integrated JrCs fadt patch (kept for RC5 the existing DSDT.aml  retry algo that disapeared in his patch, should be more discussed for RC6)
- Added JrCs modified convention name change to coding_standards
- Now malloc (ex. MALLOC in Asere patch) is renamed malloc(size) and is an alias 
  to safe_malloc(size, file, line) with _FILE_ and _LINE_ prerocessor definitions
- Added a new 'Rename Partition Feature', now permitting to rename partition 
  like 'System reserved' to a more meaningful name
- Added SystemID option permitting to change the System UUID to a fixed value.
- Added the PciRoot autodetection feature imported from pcefi10.5
- Added automatic "system-id" injection from dmi bios, also compatible 
  with SystemID boot option and former SMUUID from smbios,plist
- Added "system-type' automatic injection (1=Desktop) plus override possibility 
  with the new system-type option in bootConfig
- Added SMserial and SMproductname new options for smbios.plist
- Merged with asere patch, while keeping my fake_efi.c changes, and adding a new 
  stringForKey() API, also changed the DT__XXXX() set of functions 
  to handle const char * values instead of char*.
