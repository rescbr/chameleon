This is a sub folder of the Azimutz branch.

It was branched from the trunk, to hold the AutoResolution patch created by Lebidou.
The patch is slight reworked by me, mostly due to bug fixing and adaptation to the
trunk changes over time.

Please note that the patch contained here, is a direct port of the original work;
it is not based on the one found in the AutoResolution branch, which was created
by Diebuche to hold the original patch, for both documentation and eventual merge
to the trunk.


Credits and Thanks to Lebidou.

Original patch and topic:

Additional Thanks fly out to Diebuche, which if i'm not mistaken, was the inspiration
for this patch with his "Information on VESA modes in ATI&NVIDIA bios, &how to mod them."
