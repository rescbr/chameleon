GraphicsEnabler & GraphicsEnablerLegacy modules:

 GraphicsEnablerLegacy module is based on the old code, previous to r786. This module was created
by Meklort; i just added the new ATI code in.

Note: GraphicsEnablerLegacy has support for some GMA graphics, basically the same
	  that can be found on Meklort's branch.

- both modules work properly when compiled with XCode 3.2.6.
- the use of XCode 4 causes problems atm, not only to the module system.
  See: http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?s=&showtopic=231075&view=findpost&p=1683785
  as an example.
- i have no plans to keep working on these modules; the old ATI code was never meant to support
  these legacy cards like my rv516 gpu, according to Netkas. So, i will try to resort to DSDT injection.
  If i fail on doing that, then i may get back to this...? time and money to buy a new graphics
  card, will tell :)


Thanks to everyone that worked on these patches; i'm mostly just gathering their work.
