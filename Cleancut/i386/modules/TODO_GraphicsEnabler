- get testers for GraphicsEnabler module (new ATI code); i have no way to test it.
- review & clean up
- break these modules into e.g. ATIEnabler/ATIEnablerLegacy, NVIDIAEnabler, GMAEnabler ??
- remove this file when done :)

Note: No problems compiling with either XCode 3.2.6 or 4.0.2.
	  GraphicsEnablerLegacy has support for some GMA graphics, basically the same
	  that can be found on Meklort's branch.

Thanks to everyone that worked on these patches; i'm mostly just gathering their work.
