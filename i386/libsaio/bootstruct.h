 PrivateBootInfo has fields used by the booter that used to be part of
 KernelBootArgs_t *bootArgs.  When the switch was made to EFI the structure
 completely changed to boot_args *bootArgs.  This (new to boot-132) structure
 contains the fields the kernel no longer cares about but the booter still
 uses internally.  Some fields (e.g. the video information) remain interesting
 to the kernel and are thus located in bootArgs although with different field names.
