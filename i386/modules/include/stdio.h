 *
 * _ub, _up, and _ur are used when ungetc() pushes back more characters
 * than fit in the current _bf, or when ungetc() pushes back a character
 * that does not match the previous one in _bf.  When this happens,
 * _ub._base becomes non-nil (i.e., a stream has ungetc() data iff
 * _ub._base!=NULL) and _up and _ur save the current values of _p and _r.
