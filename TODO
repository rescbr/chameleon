TODO List for Chameleon Boot Loader
====================================

- Implement a Host like in bits to avoid some return issues

- Implement snprintf to avoid buffer overflow in some case

- It seems that nvram variables must be set thru efiRuntimeServices->SetVariable(...),
  then, the /options node is filled by kernel depending on the Runtime Services.
  If true, this requires a more complete EFI implementation (perhaps in a module, or a kext).

- Make an OS X server icon for LoginToLion
