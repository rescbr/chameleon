TODO List for Chameleon Boot Loader
====================================

- Update cpu_intel_amd.c

- Implement the bundles

- Implement a pool allocator, so each module will run and allocate memory in there own pool, de-alloc all allocated memory by the module, 
  will be done simply by destroying the pool

- (re-)Implement a watchdog library set (clear the watchdog , can avoid infinite loop made for unknow reasons by the compiler or cpu reset) 

- Implement a Host like in bits to avoid some return issues

- Implement snprintf to avoid buffer overflow in some case

- It seems that nvram variables must be set thru efiRuntimeServices->SetVariable(...),
  then, the /options node is filled by kernel depending on the Runtime Services.
  If true, this requires a more complete EFI implementation (perhaps in a module, or a kext).

- Make an OS X server icon for LoginToLion
