TODO List for Chameleon Boot Loader
====================================

- Find out who to build libstuff & ld_classic inside this project

- Move acpicodec to the IndustryStandard acpi efi library

- split nvidia, gma and ati code into separate modules
- move device_inject, MBR (OSX works better on Guid partition theme anyway), winfs, bsdfs, ext2fs, befs, and the command lspci, memory, more and video into modules
- Implement a pool allocator, so each module will run and allocate memory in there own pool, de-alloc all allocated memory by the module, 
  will be done simply by destroying the pool

- implement cpu topology
- Backport cconfig from the trunk
- Implement a Host like in bits to avoid some return issues

- update project with corehash

NOTE: It seems that nvram variables must be set thru efiRuntimeServices->SetVariable(...),
  then, the /options node is filled by kernel depending on the Runtime Services.
  If true, this requires a more complete EFI implementation (perhaps in a module, or a kext).

- Make an OS X server icon for LoginToLion
