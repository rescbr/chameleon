                        Chameleon Boot Loader
                        =====================

  What is it?
  -----------

  Chameleon is combination of various boot loader components. It is based
  on David Elliott's fake EFI implementation added to Apple's boot-132
  project. Chameleon is extended with the following key features:
  

  Features
  --------
  
   - Device Property Injection via device-properties string in com.apple.Boot.plist
   - hybrid boot0+boot1h loaders for both MBR and GPT partitioned disks.
   - automatic FSB detection code even for recent AMD CPUs.
   - Apple Software RAID support.
   - stage2 loader (boot) can be placed as a regular file in the boot
     partition's root folder.
   - Modules
     

                        Installation
                        ============
  
  Normal Install (non-RAID):
  --------------------------
  
  Suppose that your installation is on /dev/disk0s2
  
   - Install boot0 to the MBR:
   		sudo ./fdisk440 -f boot0 -u -y /dev/rdisk0
  
   - Install boot1h to the partition's bootsector:
  		sudo dd if=boot1h of=/dev/rdisk0s2
  
   - Install boot to the partition's root directory:
  		sudo cp boot /
	
   - Install Symbols and modules to the partition's root directory or the partition's booter  (if needed):   
		* Symbols.bundle is absolutely needed if you plan to use any other module, 
		* otherwise Symbols.bundle necessary, assume that /Extra is already created (if you need special permissions, use sudo)
		
		mkdir /Extra/modules
		cp Symbols.bundle /Extra/modules 
		cp "Any other module wanted".bundle /Extra/modules (additionally you can also insert a bundle as a plugin in any other module, in "THE_BUNDLE".bundle/Contents/PlugIns)

   No need to use startupfiletool anymore!

IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT THE MODULES: PLEASE NOTE THAT ALL MODULES ARE NOT NECESSARILY NEEDED TO BE INSTALLED, YOU JUST HAVE TO INSTALL WHAT YOU NEED, 
FOR EXAMPLE: 
 - IF YOU DON'T PLAN TO USE A RAMDISK (PREBOOT.DMG OR POSTBOOT.IMG), YOU WILL SURELY NOT NEED TO INSTALL THE RAMDISKLOADER MODULE, 
 - IF YOU DON'T PLAN TO BOOT FROM AN HIBERNATE IMAGE YOU WILL SURELY NOT NEED TO INSTALL THE HIBERNATEENABLER MODULE, 
 - IF YOUR MACHINE IS NOT A NETBOOK, YOU WILL SURELY NOT NEED TO INSTALL THE NETBOOKINSTALLER MODULE,
 - IF YOU DON'T NEED TO PATCH THE KERNEL ON THE FLY, PLEASE DO NOT INSTALL THE KERNELPATCHER MODULE,
 - ETC,ETC,ETC

HERE IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON USAGE:

- ACPICODEC and ACPIPATCHER (FOR ACPI FIXES, AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN ALREADY PATCHED BIOS)
- GRAPGHICENABLER (IF YOU HAVE NOT FIXED THIS BY THE DSDT, THIS MODULE CAN ADD THE EFI STRING FOR YOUR GRAPHIC CARD)
- GUI (IF YOU WANT A GUI)
- KEYMAPPER (IF YOU WANT TO REMAP YOUR KEYBOARD (AN AZERTY PRESET IS AVAILABLE), SEE MODULEHELP.TXT FOR USAGE)
- SMBIOSGETTERS and SMBIOSPATCHER (FOR SMBIOS FIXES, AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN ALREADY PATCHED BIOS)
- MEMORY (FOR RAM DETECTION, THIS MODULE IS ACTUALLY A PLUGIN FOR SMBIOSGETTERS OR SMBIOSPATCHER, AND IT WILL NOT WORK WITHOUT ONE OF THEM, IT WILL BE MORE CLEAR WITH THE BUNDLED MODULES)
- SYMBOLS IS ABSOLUTELY NEEDED IF YOU USE AT LEAST ONE OTHER MODULE

LAST THING, PLEASE NOTE THAT ALL MODULES ARE ENABLED BY DEFAULT ONCE THEY ARE INSTALLED, THERE IS NO NEED TO ENABLE THEM BY AN OPTION BUT OF COURSE YOU CAN DISABLE A MODULE EVEN IF THE MODULE IS INSTALLED  
  
  
  RAID Install:
  -------------
  
  Suppose that your installation is on /dev/disk3, which is either a mirror- or a
  stripeset consisting of /dev/disk0 and /dev/disk1

  Mac OS X creates a small helper partition at the end of each RAID member disk,
  namely /dev/disk0s3 and /dev/disk1s3
  
   - Install boot0 to the MBR of both disks:
  		sudo ./fdisk440 -f boot0 -u -y /dev/rdisk0
  		sudo ./fdisk440 -f boot0 -u -y /dev/rdisk1
  
   - Install boot1h to the bootsector of each boot partition:
  		sudo dd if=boot1h of=/dev/rdisk0s3
  		sudo dd if=boot1h of=/dev/rdisk1s3
  
   - Install boot to both helper partition's root directories.
  		diskutil mount disk0s3
  		cp boot /Volumes/Boot\ OSX
  		diskutil unmount disk0s3
  		diskutil mount disk1s3
  		cp boot /Volumes/Boot\ OSX
  		diskutil unmount disk1s3
