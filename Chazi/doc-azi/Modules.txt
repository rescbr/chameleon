				---------------// Modules Info //---------------

Installation:

  - get the source, compile; find modules at /sym/i386, with .dylib file extension.

  - create an /Extra/modules folder on the volume from were the booter is going to load from,
	copy Symbols.dylib (mandatory) to modules folder, plus any other module you wish to load.

  - update boot file or reinstall the booter completely, as needed.	

  Note: GraphicsEnabler, MemDetect & ForceHPET patches are now converted to modules.


How to use?

  - Just check if a key is needed to activate the functionality you pretend to use. Otherwise
	all modules are loaded at startup from the default location, before the boot prompt.

	---------------//---------------//---------------

What are modules?

  - Modules can be refered as "plugins", adding and/or replacing booter functionality, without
	touching the "core" of the booter. If you are familiar with e.g. browser plugins
	(like Firefox's Addons), you know what i'm talking about; they either add completely new
	functionality or replace/modify existing one; same thing with modules and Chameleon.
	
	More info can be found on Meklort's blog and links at the bottom of the page:
	http://www.meklort.com/

	---------------//---------------//---------------

Featured modules:

  - Symbols.dylib: first one to load, contains all the symbols found on the booter.
	All other modules depend on it to load.

	---------------//---------------

  - KernelPatcher.dylib:

	- needs key to enable patching:
	
		PatchKernel=y			at boot prompt or,

		<key>PatchKernel</key>	on Boot.plist.
		<string>Yes</string>
	
	- featured patches: cpuid_set - 32/64 bit ??
						commpage_stuff - 32/64 bit
						lapic_init - 32 bit only.

	Note on functionality: as it is, Kpatcher allows my Pentium D 925 to load vanilla(*)
	kernel, with the help of -legacy flag; to enter x86_64 world i still need to patch
	the kernel sources, as the 925 has no Supplemental SSE3 instructions and there's
	no patch to fix this on Kpatcher atm.
	I assume that, the great majority of the legacy/unsupported processors with at least
	SSE3 instructions, will benefit of the same treatment!
	Let's just say that the only patch needed by the 925 on Legacy Mode(**) is cpuid_set!
	
	Note: Kernel Patcher can stop working due to changes on the kernel code.

	---------------//---------------

  - GraphicsEnabler.dylib: GraphicsEnabler converted to module.

	---------------//---------------

  - Memory.dylib: MemDetection converted to module.

	---------------//---------------

  - HPET.dylib: ForceHPET converted to module.

	---------------//---------------
	
  - HelloWorld.dylib: just a notifier (not mandatory).

	---------------//---------------//---------------


(*) In this context, "vanilla" means the use of a non pre-patched kernel; what we do here is
	patch the kernel on the fly, in memory.

(**) For those who "missed" the lesson, Legacy Mode is the one 32 bit only cpu's run on OS X.


	---------------//---------------//---------------

Issues:

  - compiling modules under Leo (Dev tools 3.1 (9M2809)) is not possible at the moment.
