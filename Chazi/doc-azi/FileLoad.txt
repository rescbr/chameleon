Well, the intention here is to give some insight on Chameleon file loading, as well as providing
detailed info about what files are (or can be) loaded, from what devices, used paths, differences
between paths, if there's user overriding available, etc...
For now, it will just focus on comparing what's available (on trunk) and one of the many "paths"
we can follow (my branch); also, only the most frequently used files are featured.
For the purpose of comparison, there's a FileLoad-trunk.txt similar to this one, that will
reflect the current Chameleon (trunk) status on the matter.

To be honest, the info on this file will depend greatly on "feedback"; writing down this stuff it's
not the most pleasing and fruitful task i have to do atm, time is never enough and i don't feel
particularly inspired for the job atm; so if i see no interest in this,
i will ditch it as quickly as i started it.


Note: unless other wise specified, first file found is the one used.

Note: path/name search is not case sensitive! Meaning that:
- this /Extra/DSDT.aml
- or this /extra/dsdt.aml
points exactly to the same location.

Before we go on:
- Selected volume = root volume (volume/partition were a system is installed)
- Booter volume   = boot volume (volume/partition were the bootloader installed)

Ramdisks (rd) are simple image files (dmg, etc...) most commonly associated with the pre-boot discs
used to boot retail Mac OS X Installer dvd's; in this case, they are used to load needed files into
memory, before discs can be swapped. But, pre-boot it's not their only use; they can be loaded from
any device the booter has access to and used to test/load, from kexts to complete boot configurations.
A rd aliased as bt(0,0), is a normal rd with a btalias activated pointing to it. The btalias is activated
via a configuration file placed on the root of the rd (RAMDisk.plist), using the pair BTAlias=y.
When this alias is activated on a rd, all paths started by bt(0,0) (pointing to the Booter volume)
will instead point to the rd. This makes rd's aliased as bt, ideal to load full sets of files,
like when using the mentioned pre-boot discs.

Helper partitions - boot support partitions (Apple_Boot)
Need to gather more info on these, since i have no experience with them.
All i can say for now is that /com.apple.boot.P /com.apple.boot.R /com.apple.boot.S are directories on
Apple_boot partitions. So far, the only real case scenario i could find that uses these partitions is
software RAID, were the root partition can't be accessed before the "software RAID" is running.
In this situation, these partitions are used as Booter volume and hold the necessary files, that on a
normal setup are loaded directly from the root volume (were the system is installed).
Here is a link to the only decent explanation i ever found on the net:

I'm not searching /Extra/com.apple.Boot.plist on Default paths (c.a.B.plist on selected volume).
The reason is pretty evident, if we don't forget that this booter only loads files from booter volume.
But that's not all; there's also a concept so, for now i'm going to focus only on it.
The concept is: Default configuration file should be loaded either from the Booter volume or from one
of the default system paths.
Why? Because it's the Default configuration file, with the Default configuration files, that the booter
is supposed to use by Default, on a hands-off situation. All these values can still be override by
the user in more ways than one, if the user wishes so! (read 4*)
Wish we could use just "One" default path!??

(4*)
Here i have my doubts if what i have is the ideal, if there's any ideal situation to follow?!
Anyway, explaining what i have now and why.
I'm not searching Default paths for now because:
- they are already checked when loading the Default configuration. In "many" situations
  (not to say "most") this will just be reloading the already loaded values.
- on this booter, Selected volume is replaced by the use of a specific OS folder so, in some sense
  the selected volume is still checked. And there's also a override key!

My doubts are related to the fact that, searching default paths here does make sense (in a way)
and i'm not entirely sure that's not needed in some configurations?! It's just that, the way
it's done now it gets confuse...
Does using a different name for the Override configuration file make any sense??

ssdt: need to gather more info on these, since i have no experience with them.
As far as i understand, same paths as for dsdt.aml are used and if anything different from "dsdt.aml"
is found, it's loaded. 30 tables can be loaded and must be named as:
ssdt.aml, ssdt-1.aml, ssdt-2.aml,... ssdt-30.aml ??? bla bla bla... damn confusion :-/


reminder:
- no ambiguous paths
- what override paths can be used.
