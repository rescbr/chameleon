 Project topic: http://forum.voodooprojects.org/index.php/topic,1227.0.html
there you can find latest sources and boot files posted by LeBidou, as well as most
of the feedback and project history. Source can also be found, in a more or less
up to date form on AutoResolution branch and CleanCut folder under my branch;
as of this writing i'm considering those as "obsolete", replaced by what i have at
the moment on Chazi folder.

Some more references can be found on this topic by DieBuche:

in fact, the first post is the best explanation you can get on how the patch works,
with the difference that the patch does it "on the fly" while booting, in an "Auto"
way (hence the AutResolution name) using the resolution retrieved from the display's
EDID or provided with "Graphics Mode" argument.
But, don't stay only with the first post! I won't get into technical details, simply
because i don't have the knowledge to. All i do is try to keep the patch working with
latest Chameleon changes and that's obviously because i use it :)
Will add more info with time if it's justifiable.

Enough talk...
What can this patch do for you and when?

Well, if you never experienced booting with your native resolution, or worse, you don't
even have it after login, there's a chance that this can help you, providing you have
the luck of having the right hardware. If it works, it will provide you with native
resolution even if you don't have any graphics acceleration at all; remember, this has
nothing to do with "Graphics Enabler" or depends on it in any way.
Intel chipset is needed; the newer the worse :P read the topics and check the list below.
Graphics card, it depends... ATI's are the best supported, but BIOS and motherboard have
something to say so, the best is try it.

How to try?
