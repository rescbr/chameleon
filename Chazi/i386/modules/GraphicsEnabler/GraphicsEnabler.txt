This is a port of the graphics enabler code into modules,
based on Meklort's previous port; for all purposes, this is
his work; i'm just trying to help ease the work load and
learn something while doing it.

Though the modules are in a working state and considered by me
as fit for testing (and use), this is still work in progress.
Please feedback directly to me by pm at:

NOTICE: as of now, i'm considering this work as "LOW PRIORITY".
The folder will be kept synced with the trunk.
Work on the code will be done on a "free time" basis.
Any dev that wants to work directly on the folder is welcome;
i will take care of the "syncing with trunk" part.

The main reason for this is:
there are more important things to fix on the booter.
